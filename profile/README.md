## ‚öôÔ∏è Overview

This **Aim Assist** doesn‚Äôt lock onto opponents or modify online gameplay ‚Äî instead, it operates as an **input analyzer** and **visual overlay** that reads your mouse data and helps you measure drift, speed, and reaction times.

You can train with custom recoil profiles, adjust smoothing curves, and run timed flick drills to boost crosshair placement accuracy.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool is for **offline training, aim maps, and custom scenarios** only. It is 100% **safe**, **non-intrusive**, and compliant with anti-cheat rules.
